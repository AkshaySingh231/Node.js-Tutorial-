There is one Call Stack and one Callback Queue. When synchronous code runs,
 it goes directly to the Call Stack and executes immediately.
Asynchronous functions (like setTimeout, setImmediate, promises, etc.) 
are handled by the browser or Node.js APIs.
Once the async work is finished, the callback is sent to the Queue.
The Event Loop checks if the Call Stack is empty; if yes,
 it moves the callback from the Queue into the Call Stack and executes it
